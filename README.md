# potato-leaf-disease-using-cnn
This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can classify potato leaves into three classes: healthy, early blight and late blight.
Early blight and late blight are two common diseases that affect potato crops and cause significant losses in yield and quality. 
By using image processing and deep learning techniques, this project can help farmers and agronomists to detect and diagnose potato leaf diseases accurately and efficiently.
